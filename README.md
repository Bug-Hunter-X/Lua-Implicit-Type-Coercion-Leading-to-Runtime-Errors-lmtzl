This repository demonstrates a common error in Lua programming that arises from implicit type coercion. Lua's dynamic typing system can lead to runtime errors if arithmetic or other operations are performed on incompatible data types.  The `bug.lua` file shows a function that attempts to add 1 to a string, resulting in an error. The solution, `bugSolution.lua`, demonstrates how to handle this by explicitly checking the type of the input before attempting arithmetic operations.
